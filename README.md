# Rust Matrix
### Goal: 
The goal of this project is to create a library for **personal** use that adds the matrix data structure. The structure 
should implement traits allowing for the matrix to be indexed, summed, subracted, multiplied, and potentially divided.
Furthermore, the matrix structure should be generic to an extent allowing for different numerical types to be stored
within it.

### TODO:
- [ ] Write a tests to ensure that as the project is written it is working as expected
- [ ] Create a matrix structure which can accept multiple numerical data types
- [ ] Implement a trait allowing for the matrices to be indexed
- [ ] Implement addition and subtraction to the matrices
- [ ] Implement multiplication (and division) for the matrix structure
- [ ] Optimise the operations
